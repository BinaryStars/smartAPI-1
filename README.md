# smartAPI
Intelligent APIs for a more connected web.

A BD2K/Network-of-BioThings project.

smartAPI allows API publishers to annotate their services and input/output parameters in a structured and identifiable manner, based on a standard JSON-LD format for biomedical APIs and services. By indexing and visualizing these descriptions as Linked Data in a MongoDB back-end, researchers can seamlessly identify the services that consume or return desired parameters, and automatically compose services in workflows that yield new insights.
